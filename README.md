Mastermind

Mastermind is a board game where players take turns playing as codebreaker and codesetter. The codesetter's task is to choose a combination of four numbers for the codebreaker to guess. The codebreaker gets feedback on each guess:
- If a number is correct but in the wrong place
- If a number is correct and in the right place
- If a number is not in the code.
